// Why: thresholds for escalating connection UX from neutral
// "Reconnecting…" to alarming "host appears unreachable, re-pair?".
//
// - WARNING_ATTEMPTS: 3 → label flips to "Can't connect" (existing
//   behavior). Calibrated to absorb a normal laptop wake / brief
//   network blip without alarming the user.
// - UNREACHABLE_ATTEMPTS: 12 → with the tiered 0.5s→60s backoff this
//   is ≈ 6 minutes of continuous failure (the last four attempts all
//   reuse the 60s cap). Combined with the never-connected /
//   stale-since-last-connect heuristic below, this is the trigger to
//   surface a "re-pair?" affordance. MUST stay aligned with
//   rpc-client.ts GIVE_UP_AFTER_ATTEMPTS.
// - STALE_SINCE_LAST_CONNECT_MS: 60s → if we WERE connected this
//   session but haven't been for ≥ 1 minute despite the retry loop
//   spinning, treat the same as never-connected. Catches the case
//   where the desktop's IP changed mid-session.
